# Task-4 : Classification with Logistic Regression


##  Objective

Build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using diagnostic features. The task includes model training, evaluation, threshold tuning, and visualizing the underlying mechanics.

##  Dataset

- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset
- **Target Column**: `diagnosis`
  - `M` â†’ Malignant (1)
  - `B` â†’ Benign (0)

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** â€” Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** â€” Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€” Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€” Machine learning model building and evaluation

---

##  Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Load the dataset from `data.csv`
   - Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., ID columns)
   - Encode categorical target variable (`diagnosis`) to numerical

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize class distribution
   - Generate correlation heatmap
   - Plot distributions of key features

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Standardize features using `StandardScaler`

4. **Model Training**
   - Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Predict on test data
   - Evaluate using:
     - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
     - Confusion matrix
     - ROC curve and AUC score

6. **Threshold Tuning**
   - Adjust decision threshold (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.6)
   - Observe changes in evaluation metrics

7. **Sigmoid Function Visualization**
   - Plot the sigmoid function to understand logistic regression behavior

---

##  Results

- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, F1-score for each class
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows true vs. predicted classifications
- **ROC Curve**: Illustrates the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate
- **AUC Score**: Measures the area under the ROC curve
